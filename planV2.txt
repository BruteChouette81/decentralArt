plan to partially remove crypto using protocol (convention code)

NAME: Centralized payment ledger 

DESCRIPTION: portocol or convention to allow fiat payment to be as decentralized as crypto payment.


architecture: 

1. user ==> transfer fiat to payment processing oracle with key (keccak DID first 10 chars )
2. payment processing oracle ==> transfer $credits to user (lock fiat in account) ==> gas fees
3. transfer $credits to market (lock them in market)
4. transfer $credits to seller once approoved 
5. exchange $credits to oracle (stake or go)
6. if stake: setup a centralized retrieval method
7. stake USDC and gather rewards  

(4.) if not approved in time: transfer $credits to buyer and exchange them for fiat

oracle: own ETH account that authenticate in the Only pool 

**important: apply changes to decentralized payment system to keep everything together

**important: gas fee: make the oracle pay for it, but charge seller with it (penality on $credits next time they want to retrieve cash) -> make cash on penalities

**important: proof of decentralization: creation of new account + never changing address

**didtransfer: seller _address/ buyer _address .txt
