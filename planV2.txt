plan to partially remove crypto using protocol (convention code)

NAME: Centralized payment ledger 

DESCRIPTION: portocol or convention to allow fiat payment to be as decentralized as crypto payment.


architecture: 

1. user ==> transfer fiat to payment processing oracle with key (keccak DID first 10 chars )
2. payment processing oracle ==> transfer $credits to user (lock fiat in account) ==> gas fees
3. transfer $credits to market (lock them in market)
4. transfer $credits to seller once approoved 
5. exchange $credits to oracle (stake or go)
6. if stake: setup a centralized retrieval method
7. stake USDC and gather rewards  

(4.) if not approved in time: transfer $credits to buyer and exchange them for fiat

oracle: own ETH account that authenticate in the Only pool 

**important: apply changes to decentralized payment system to keep everything together

**important: gas fee: make the oracle pay for it, but charge seller with it (penality on $credits next time they want to retrieve cash) -> make cash on penalities

list of applicable fees: 
-> mint nft using oracle to contract 0.5 ==> 0.0000626268 0.15$ 0.0000810796 0.15$ 0.0000626244 0.15$
-> mint token 0.5 ==> 0.0000683518 or 0.15 $ high price 
-> allowance 0.5 ==> 0.0000713429 or 0.15 $ high price 
-> transfer 0.5 ==> 0.0001127293 or 0.25 $ high price 
-> (refund--> eliminate gas use CPL)
-> proove 0.5 ==>0.0000855221 or 0.20 $ high price 
-> burn 0.5 ==> 0.0000683518 or 0.15 $ high price 

total: 1,5$ we chage 3$

max amount 3$ --> be return minus penalities

**important: proof of decentralization: creation of new account + never changing address

**didtransfer: seller _address/ buyer _address .txt

list of tests: 
    - did (meta and imperial) --> change pk to password
    - did transfer
    - paypal buying  DONE ✔️ --> frontend 
    - crypto buying (disabled)
    - retrieving money
    - gas CALCULATING !!! tracking / penalities 
    - feed the oracle eth (2-3$ per items ) --> build a eth automatic buyer system -> for staking
