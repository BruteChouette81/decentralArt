plan to partially remove crypto using protocol (convention code)

NAME: Centralized payment ledger 

DESCRIPTION: portocol or convention to allow fiat payment to be as decentralized as crypto payment.


architecture: 

1. user ==> transfer fiat to payment processing oracle with key (keccak DID first 10 chars )
2. payment processing oracle ==> transfer $credits to user (lock fiat in account) ==> gas fees
3. transfer $credits to market (lock them in market)
4. transfer $credits to seller once approoved 
5. exchange $credits to oracle (stake or go)
6. if stake: setup a centralized retrieval method
7. stake USDC and gather rewards  

(4.) if not approved in time: transfer $credits to buyer and exchange them for fiat

oracle: own ETH account that authenticate in the Only pool 

**important: apply changes to decentralized payment system to keep everything together

**important: gas fee: make the oracle pay for it, but charge seller with it (penality on $credits next time they want to retrieve cash) -> make cash on penalities

list of applicable fees: 
-> mint nft using oracle to contract 0.5 ==> 0.0000626268 0.15$ 0.0000810796 0.15$ 0.0000626244 0.15$
-> mint token 0.5 ==> 0.0000683518 or 0.15 $ high price 
-> allowance 0.5 ==> 0.0000713429 or 0.15 $ high price 
-> transfer 0.5 ==> 0.0001127293 or 0.25 $ high price 
-> (refund--> eliminate gas use CPL)
-> proove 0.5 ==>0.0000855221 or 0.20 $ high price 
-> burn 0.5 ==> 0.0000683518 or 0.15 $ high price 

total: 1,5$ we chage 3$

max amount 3$ --> be return minus penalities

**important: proof of decentralization: creation of new account + never changing address

**didtransfer: seller _address/ buyer _address .txt

STAKING/DEFI: 

- choose a defi service or pay after a certain point
- terms can be arguable (time of invest)
- all crypto is collected our side using centralized exchange 
- after transfering to dollars: automarize a connected other paypal account to transfer funds to user

list of tests: 
    - did (meta and imperial) --> change pk to password
    - did transfer
    - paypal buying  DONE ✔️ --> frontend 
    - crypto buying (disabled)
    - retrieving money
    - gas CALCULATING !!! tracking / penalities 
    - feed the oracle eth (2-3$ per items ) --> build a eth automatic buyer system -> for staking 
    - 

PLAN + TEST:

goal: test the app in its most primitive state

things to do before test:

- Mint / multiple Mint -> list on oracle (modify contracts) DONE ✔️

- complete purchase on oracle DONE ✔️

- complete retrival (submitProof and burning) DONE ✔️

- retrieve cash with oracle DONE ✔️

class contracts to see which we need and add function and finish them DONE ✔️

make a archive file and remove every none-used functionnalities (metamask and ...)

TEST:

- mint real item DONE ✔️ EC: 10

- multiMint real items DONE ✔️ EC: 20

- database mint  OK ✔️

- load did password / create account DONE ✔️
- load did market DONE ✔️
//0x953888Ae66748E5732a95D65e9460724D56e8957 
// laptop: 0x19CcD7690B3a9e57225F041DB28705F9E9Ec9153

- load item market  DONE ✔️ 
- calculate good fees / penalities on market (2.9% for paypal + 4$ for our fees) ==> in console.jsx and nfts.jsx DONE ✔️ 
- all in canadian DONE ✔️ check to be sure
- ensure that bytes are chill (underflow/overflow: reduce to two decimals points) ==> prices are offset by one in the item list (good in contract) DONE ✔️ 

BEFORE RELEASE:
- clean cpl app.js
- check feeding (amount of gas in cpl)
- check underflow (bytes)
- check any other error that we might enconter using the market (exception reverted)
-> error system to handle all errors DONE ✔️

- calculate fees in form and add staking program oportunity DONE ✔️
- no more bug for nft owner ==> nft receiver (DONE ✔️)

- mintBuy DONE ✔️ EC: 50

- did transfer  DONE ✔️

- submitProof and go  DONE ✔️ EC: 40

- way to add a paypal address DONE ✔️

- refunds test + new market payout DONE ✔️ EC: 30

- delete Item: takes the fee of refund ==> need to modify contract ==> push contract and ABI DONE ✔️ EC: 60

- CPL secret: private key, public address / CPL amelioration

- password bug DONE ✔️

- style DONE ✔️

- my items in market DONE ✔️

- categories in market / my items OK ✔️

- individual items link (facebook) DONE ✔️

- load item in chunk (quicker) DONE ✔️ + delete db and get infos from uri + fast search (from indexing) OK ✔️

- relocate loading item in nftbox ==> load every singular items one by one DONE ✔️

- fix multiMint error (get ids of items from contract before) DONE ✔️ ==> test DONE ✔️

- adapt price DONE ✔️

- time out bug DONE ✔️

- handle more items at a time: split numreal in ticks, load the first 10 items, then set interval to autorise the displaying of the rest DONE ✔️ ==> apply it everywhere DONE ✔️

- multi mint: last token id erc721 bug ==> review multipleMint method in Rnft.sol and multipleMintList in dds.sol ==> DONE ✔️

- push new dds contract for retrieve cash ==> credit.sol: address _pool = public, retriveCredit in dds.sol ==> test retrieve cash ==> OK ✔️

- decentralized the minting process (more ipfs nodes) ==> OK ✔️

- reorganize OK ✔️

- one button load of your commands DONE ✔️=> make its own page => use Rnft.sol contract to get metadata DONE ✔️

- on/off account DONE ✔️

- remove debug alert DONE ✔️ ==> log

->>>>>> Real life Transaction: PROOVED ✔️

- push fee % getting in app.js  

- more cpl documentation + public ledger using uuid ID's and block scan for transactions database

- reopen cpl technology site: cpltechnology.net w/ new design / whitepaper DONE ✔️
